New services, APIs, enhanced functions, and even websites can be hard to grasp. At DataCite we understand how difficult it is to get started and stay up-to-date with all the developments in the scholarly communications ecosystem. That is why we decided to pull all DataCite's information into a single Support Center. Our goal is to present our user community with a complete, up-to-date, easy to read, searchable resource.

Visit [https://support.datacite.org](https://support.datacite.org) to search or browse the content and start reading!
