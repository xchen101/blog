Prior to joining DataCite, Helena worked as Senior Product Manager for Research Data Management solutions at Elsevier where she was responsible for developing research data related outreach activities, providing Elsevier journals with data solutions, and managing partnerships with academic institutions. Helena’s research data outreach activities included managing relationships with data repositories, establishing partner programs with universities, providing insight into the researcher workflow, and developing solutions through extensive user testing. We welcome this mix of experience to the DataCite team. 

Helena has a passion for open data can data sharing. While obtaining her PhD in neuroscience from the University of Oxford she developed a strong interest in research data. Over the past several years, Helena has become a very active participant in the data community.  She has worked on many important data initiatives such as the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, data linking through the Scholix framework, a data section within the journal submission system, and an accompanying data policy for all Elsevier journals. This work has allowed her to become an important voice in the data community. Helena also co-chairs working groups and committees in organizations such as the RDA and FORCE11, sits on advisory boards and is a frequent speaker at conferences. 

Britta, Martin, Richard, Kristian, Robin, and I look forward to Helena joining our team on July 1st.  As you welcome Helena, you can look forward to many interactions with her as she rolls out DataCite’s new communications and outreach strategy.
