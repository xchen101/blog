We are happy to announce that we are taking the final steps on our way to providing you with all the relevant information you need. We outlined this transition already [last year](https://doi.org/10.5438/yx6w-7595), meaning to move away from our current mailing lists to mailing lists that will be based on member information available in DataCite Fabrica. We are excited to announce that this step will happen this week.

## Updates needed

A lot of our members have already updated their contact information in Fabrica so that they can receive relevant information depending on the roles they have assigned to their contacts. This enables voting representatives to receive notifications for board elections, service contacts to receive invitations to open hours or consortium leads to receive announcements for events, to give a few examples. We have now made some changes in Fabrica to enable you to add more contacts and easily assign roles to the contacts.

## allmembers subscribers should update their information using the new fields in Fabrica

We have made 3 contacts (service, voting and billing) mandatory to allow us to capture vital information to contact our members. To facilitate this we have introduced a new workflow for adding and updating contact information. We have added a new `Contacts` menu to your accounts to manage contact information. `Contacts` area can be used to add, update and delete contact information. Once you have added your contacts via the `Contact` menu, you can assign roles to the added contacts in the `Settings` menu. The added contacts will appear in a drop down menu for you to assign roles for each contact. As of today, all of these changes apply to the Fabrica test environment too.

**Please note that the option to create new repositories is not available to members with incomplete contact information.**

1. Add contacts in the new contacts tab

## allusers subscribers are invited to the PIDforum

We realize that some of the subscribers on the allusers mailing lists are not part of a member organization and are therefore unable to enter their information in Fabrica. Next week, we will invite everyone on the allusers list to join the [PIDforum](https://www.pidforum.org). Created and launched as a key element of global engagement activities on PIDs within the FREYA project, the PIDforum offers different categories and (multilingual) channels to discuss PID related topics. NISO, the National Information Standards Organisation, hosts the PIDforum as a sustainable global resource for persistent identifiers. On the PIDforum DataCite moderates a private DataCite Chat Room where you can discuss DataCite related topics. Going forward, we will share all information that you used to receive via the allusers list in the DataCite chat room. In order to join these channels you need to sign up. An invitation to the PIDforum will be sent to all subscribers of the allusers mailing list next week.
