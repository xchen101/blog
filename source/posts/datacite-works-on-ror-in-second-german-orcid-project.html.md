In recent years, the creation of infrastructures for global and unique identification of researchers has been promoted by universities, research institutions, and publishers through the use and implementation of [ORCID](https://orcid.org) (Open Researcher and Contributor ID). 

In Germany, after a first successful project phase (2016-2019), the project ORCID DE (funded by the German Research Foundation, DFG) was recently granted a second funding phase (2020-2022). The successful integration of ORCID in Germany is reflected in the number ORCID iDs registered in Germany, growing from about 44,000 in April 2016 to about 168,000 in January 2020. At the beginning of 2020 the ORCID Germany Consortium, which was established in the first project phase, has 56 members.

In addition to the previous project partners in ORCID DE,  Helmholtz Open Science Office at the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ, the German National Library and Bielefeld University Library, the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) Hanover and DataCite are participating in the implementation of the project.

This second project, initiated by the German Initiative for Network Information (DINI), aims to expand and consolidate the existing network of scientific institutions that have integrated ORCID in their infrastructures. During the 30-month project period, the focus is both on the expansion of support for institutions and target groups interested in ORCID and an identification system for organisations that is linked to ORCID. DataCite, one of the steering organizations behind the Research Organization Registry ([ROR](https://ror.org)), will lead the latter. 

The grant proposal (in German) has been published and is openly available at: <https://doi.org/10.2312/lis.20.01>
