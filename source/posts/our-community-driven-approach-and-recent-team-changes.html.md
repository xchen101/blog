As we continue to evolve, our community remains at the core of everything that we do at DataCite. Our team is committed to delivering our promise of the DataCite mission.

Recently we have had some changes in our team. Robin (Product Strategy & Analysis Manager) will be leaving DataCite at the end of August. It is always unfortunate when we lose a DataCite team member and Robin will be missed by us all. During her time at DataCite, Robin worked across a range of activities, improving our member driven product strategy, delivering on related grant projects, understanding our value proposition and collaborating internally to improve our processes and coordination throughout the development journey. I would like to thank Robin for her commitment over the past two years and wish her all the best for the future. 

During times of change, it also provides an opportunity to reflect on our plans going forwards. As part of this reflection, Sarala (previously Head: Infrastructure Services) will be stepping into the role of Product Engineering Director. I would like to congratulate Sarala and we look forward to working with her in the new role. DataCite will continue to serve our members across 42 countries with the 10 people on staff. We are currently drafting an updated role to join Saralaâ€™s team and will share more about this in the coming weeks.

Over the last couple of weeks we have had the opportunity to discuss our processes and further refine our responsibilities across the Product Engineering, Technology and Community Engagement teams. We have developed an updated cycle that defines the steps in our development journey:

This activity continues to align and support the priorities that we set out in the [DataCite Vision 2020](https://doi.org/10.5438/9j86-bv91). It further allows us to strengthen our commitment to being community driven. We continue to welcome feedback from the community and feel free to reach out to info@datacite.org should you have any questions or comments.
