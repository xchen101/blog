As DataCite's Technical Director I am very excited to announce that DataCite is looking for another application developer to strengthen our team. This is an opportunity to work on interesting development work around scholarly infrastructure with a focus on research data. You would join a small technical team of [one application developer based in Berlin](https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-new-application-developer/) and me based in Hannover, also in Germany.READMORE

We are particularly interested in candidates with experience in frontend development work, and with a strong Open Science background. Remote work (from somewhere in Europe) is possible.

Please take a look at the [job posting](https://www.datacite.org/jobopportunities.html) for more information and contact me by August 30 if you are interested in the position.
