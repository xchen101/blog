The program will include a mixture of PID demos, workshops, brainstorming, updates on the state of the art, and more -- and we invite your contributions. Working together we can catalyze the development of innovative tools, services and community actions.

Come share your ideas with a crowd of like-minded innovators! [Send us your session proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSej7YKQVCPTTCo8zeIS-ODjtsb5SIS299uZZBo8ZN6yD0WI5Q/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form), in a very lightweight format, by September 18.
