By offering detailed information on more than 2,000 research data repositories, [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/search) has become the most comprehensive source
of reference for research data infrastructures globally.

Through the development and advocacy of a framework for discipline-specific
research data management, Science Europe is looking at the minimum requirements
for research data repositories that can be used by funders and research organizations.
These can be used in conjunction with [Domain Data Protocols](http://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SE_Guidance_Document_RDMPs.pdf)
that individual researchers from different scientific communities will be able
to use as templates for their data management plans.

At its recent workshop in Brussels, Science Europe's Working Group on Research Data outlined their first results with requirements that emphasize persistent identifiers, metadata, data access and use, machine readability, and long-term preservation. Next steps include building consensus on the approach and requirements as well as implementation with registries, [suggesting re3data](http://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/8_SE-RDM-WS-Jan-2018_Trusted_Repositories_Rieck.pdf).

Using re3data, data repositories from every domain and in every country can be browsed by subject, country, or content type, and searched by any combination of 41 different attributes. A system of icons makes it easy for a researcher to identify key characteristics of repositories such as those that are open access, have been certified, accept deposits of data, and issue DOIs. Registry entries are curated by an international editorial board with new additions and updates every week. re3data supports the FAIR Principles and makes its information openly accessible and machine-actionable using CC0 through its API.

Based in Brussels, [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/) is an association that promotes the collective interests of Research Funding Organisations and Research Performing Organisations in Europe. Its Founding General Assembly took place in Berlin in October 2011.

re3data is a service of [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/), a leading global non-profit organisation that provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research data with a goal of helping the research community locate, identify, and cite research data with confidence.
