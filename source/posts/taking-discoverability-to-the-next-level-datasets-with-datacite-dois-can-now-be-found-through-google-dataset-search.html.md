Discoverability of research data is a core component of the research data ecosystem. Making data findable has always been one of DataCiteâ€™s main goals, with [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org] providing a tool to search for all datasets with DataCite DOIs. 

Today the discoverability of datasets was taken to the next level with the launch of [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch). Google recognized the increasing importance of data and wants to make it easier for everyone, not just researchers, to find datasets. It is similar to Google Scholar in that datasets are included wherever the data lives. This large-scale effort means increased visibility for all data repositories and provides an extra push to make all research data openly available.

To be able to include datasets from diverse sources, Google developed [guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset#source-provenance) for dataset providers to describe their data in a way that allows Google to index the metadata. These guidelines include standard metadata such as title, dataset creator, publication data, publisher, license, and description, and use [schema.org](https://schema.org), a widely used metadata standard co-developed by Google.

The schema.org metadata need to be embedded into the dataset landing page so that the Google indexer can find them, and the data repository needs to provide a sitemap file with the URLs of all dataset landing pages. By doing this the data repository not only is indexed in Google Dataset Search, but also follows our community recommendations for embedding machine-readable metadata in landing pages.

DataCite was thrilled to be involved in discussions around the development of Google Dataset Search and to test previous versions.
