DataCite Open Hours are an opportunity for anyone in the community to hear the latest updates, ask questions and engage with DataCite staff and other community members. Sometimes there’s even a festive pub quiz!

Open Hours also provides an informal, interactive forum to learn from and share with the DataCite community and gather feedback for our roadmap, which is essential to our mission. The results of our recent member survey confirmed that members really value these meetings.

## Open hours re-launch in March

To accommodate a growing and changing DataCite community, however, we’re re-launching open hours in collaboration with the product engineering team this spring with a few changes:
Bi-monthly meetings (rather than monthly), giving us more time to structure each session to make it as productive and interactive as possible
More focus on shaping DataCite services and features, including:

- Validating members’ suggestions
- Experimenting with feedback gathering techniques
- Providing guidance about how to engage with the [DataCite roadmap](https://datacite.org/roadmap) 

As always, we will welcome any questions or comments from participants during each meeting and follow-up notes will be sent afterwards..

## Consortium Leads open hours starting in April

The shift to bi-monthly open hours meetings for the general community makes room in the schedule for a new meeting series especially for those involved in leading a DataCite consortium. 

We’ve heard loud and clear that a venue for consortium leads to connect is needed, so open hours for consortium leads will begin 14 April, with 2 identical sessions at 4pm and 10pm GMT. Meetings will continue every other month, alternating with the general open hours meetings.

We will send invitations to those listed as contacts in Consortium accounts in Fabrica, so, consortium leads, please update your contacts! in your [settings page](https://support.datacite.org/docs/consortium-dashboard#settings)
