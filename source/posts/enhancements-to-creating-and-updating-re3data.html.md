We are happy to announce a new feature that enables users to more easily suggest corrections and enhancements of information about research data repositories registered in re3data.org.

Below every re3data.org record you can find the feature “submit a change request”. Clicking this button brings you to a form where you can submit changes to the repository’s registry record along with your private, optional comments and contact information:READMORE

Also new is our advanced [suggest form](http://service.re3data.org/suggest) to add research data repositories to re3data.org. By using the form, users and repository managers can provide detailed information about repositories that are not yet listed. New backend workflow system enables all changes and suggestions to be reviewed and committed in a timely manner by a member of our editorial board.
