Three years ago today Open Researcher & Contributor ID ([ORCID](http://orcid.org)) launched its service at the Outreach Meeting in Berlin.READMORE One of many tweets from the launch day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org">@orcid_org</a> the ORCID registry is live (<a href="http://t.co/2lxn0nLa">http://t.co/2lxn0nLa</a>) NPG is a proud launch partner (PR): <a href="http://t.co/9eiqe44x">http://t.co/9eiqe44x</a></p>&mdash; Nature Publishing Gp (@npgnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/npgnews/status/258256101676564480">October 16, 2012</a></blockquote>

Executive Director Laure Haak was written a nice [blog post](http://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/15/celebrating-our-third-anniversary) summarizing the achievements in the past few years, going from 0 to 1.7 million registered users, 400 members and a staff of 20. Congratulations!

On October 17, a day after the ORCID launch, DataCite started to work with ORCID in the European Commission-funded ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network [ODIN](http://odin-project.eu/), a project that has laid the groundwork for the integration of both the two services, and associated datasets. DataCite is continuing work with ORCID in the follow-up project [THOR](http://project-thor.eu/) that started in June, and there will soon be an exciting announcement about a new integration of the two services.

This birthday has a special meaning for me, as I was a member of the ORCID Board at the time, and had helped organize the launch event in Berlin, as well as the kickoff meeting of the ODIN project, and a well-attended German-language [event on author identification](https://dini.de/veranstaltungen/workshops/autorenidentifikation/) in the same venue two days before the launch, co-organized by [DINI](https://dini.de/) and the Helmholtz Association. It is really amazing how far we have come since then.

Thank you ORCID for all your great contributions!
