The strategic priorities we have set for 2020 regarding services and infrastructure are the consolidation of our services and infrastructure, and stronger emphasis on member-driven product development. These strategic priorities are only possible as DataCite revenue from membership fees has significantly increased in the last two years, providing resources for work on services and infrastructure that is most relevant to members. In the past, DataCite staff members in the development and product teams had to spend almost all their time fulfilling grant obligations, or worked on major infrastructure upgrades such as the migration to Elasticsearch [@https://doi.org/10.5438/vyd9-ty64] and the development of the [Fabrica](https://doi.datacite.org) service.

### Consolidation of our services and infrastructure

The focus of development work over the past few years has been on upgrading existing DataCite infrastructure and building new services. With the relaunch of the OAI-PMH service in December 2019 [@https://doi.org/10.5438/ppth-pz62], we have now upgraded all major DataCite infrastructure that existed in 2015. For 2020, we want to spend more time consolidating our existing services and infrastructure, scaling back new service development, of course within the ramifications of what we promised to deliver in ongoing grants such as [FREYA](https://www.project-freya.eu/en). The work planned includes

* Better monitoring and analytics of our services, e.g. better tracking of API performance 
* Prioritize stability of our infrastructure, e.g. spending more time fixing bugs
* Consolidate the number of services available to our members, e.g. merging the public DataCite Search into the Fabrica service

### Stronger emphasis on member-driven product development

This strategic priority includes two aspects: improving our process of feedback collection from DataCite members and how that informs our product development, and prioritizing our development efforts on new services or service improvements asked for by our members.

In 2020 we will improve the existing process of collecting input from our members regarding product development. These improvements will be based on how we currently collect member input via support emails, Open Hours, webinars and the DataCite General Assembly, other conversations with members, [GitHub issues](https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues) opened by members and users, and our [public roadmap](https://datacite.org/roadmap.html) that allows comments and upvoting.

While continuing to improve the process of collecting feedback from members, there are a number of new services or service improvements that have been consistently asked for by our members, and that we will prioritize working on in 2020. This includes improvements of the DOI registration form in Fabrica to cover all optional metadata properties, a public dump of all DOI metadata available for download, improvements to the query interface for searching for DOIs, and better support for text documents in the metadata schema (e.g. support for journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers).
