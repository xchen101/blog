The connections between scholarly resources generated by persistent identifiers (PIDs) and associated metadata form a graph, the PID Graph [@https://doi.org/10.5438/JWVF-8A66]. We introduced this PID Graph concept in the EC-funded [FREYA project](https://www.project-freya.eu/en), and have identified important use cases and technical requirements. In May DataCite introduced a GraphQL API to standardize and simplify how users can contribute to and consume the PID Graph [@https://doi.org/10.5438/qab1-n315]. Today we are announcing another important milestone:
