Hi there! I’m the latest addition to the DataCite team in the role of Adoption Manager for ROR and DataCite. An ardent open knowledge and persistent identifier enthusiast, I spent the past 6 years at ORCID wearing hats ranging from member support to technical lead. A librarian by training and a software developer by necessity, I thrive at the intersection of people, processes and technology. I love working to understand the human and technological aspects of systems and developing solutions that suit both the people and the machines.



Here at DataCite, I’ll be putting those people and technology skills to use by engaging with new and existing members in the community (particularly in the Americas region) to understand their workflows and systems, and to guide implementation of DataCite services. I’ll also be working with the [recently-launched service providers program](https://datacite.org/service-provider-program.html) that enables DataCite member integrations.



On the ROR side, I’ll be supporting those who are integrating ROR IDs/affiliation data into their systems and workflows, including both technical integration and metadata wrangling, such as mapping other identifiers to ROR. As ROR develops, I will also collaborate with the community to identify and support new integration points. 



I’m thrilled to join DataCite and ROR at an exciting point in the evolution of data management, scholarly communication, and persistent identifiers, and I look forward to getting started working with our active and vibrant community!
