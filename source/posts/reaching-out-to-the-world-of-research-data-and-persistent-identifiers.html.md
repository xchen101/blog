Before I came to DataCite I have been working for the Helmholtz Open Science Office spreading the idea of Open Science to researchers and research institutions alike. 

Within my work for Helmholtz I was responsible for outreach activities for topics such as author identification using the Open Researcher and Contributor iD (ORCID) or research data management promoting the registry of research data repositories (re3data). In both fields there was and still is a fundamental need to raise awareness about the important role of persistent identifiers in research. Also for this reason DataCite is an active partner in research projects such as the recently started project re3data COREF (Community Driven Open Reference for Research Data Repositories) and ORCID DE. 

In the course of re3data COREF we will develop a conceptual service model that takes into account new requirements by other stakeholders (e.g. content aggregators) using the re3data API. In addition the technical infrastructure as well as the metadata schema will be revised and updated according to FAIR criteria and the latest standards in research data management. These goals can only be met in search for a deeper understanding reaching out to the community.
