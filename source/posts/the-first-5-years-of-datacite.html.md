I came to the TIB and DataCite in 2010. Being the managing agency of DataCite, the TIB was the organizational hub of DataCite, providing not only a lot of man-power but also technical and organizatorial resources. Working at DataCite in the early years was a great adventure. We were a close and growing community expanding fast from the initial seven members to 21 members by the end of 2015. 



In the beginning, every member committed to contributing to build DataCite’s services - a commitment without which it would have been impossible to bring DataCite to the well-known . Although being situated all around the world, everybody knew everyone and we worked in a motivated and close team. All of us were motivated and full of energy, so we put in a lot of effort and time. Our annual General Assembly and the Summer Meetings - yearly conferences to connect the research data community - were welcome oppurtunities to meet each other in person. We organised us in working groups dedicated to different areas of DataCite’s business and services. The most important and persistent ones being the Metadata Working Group, the Policy and Best Practices Working Group, and, emerging from the Technical Infrastructure Working Group, the TechTeam. And from the beginning the input of the users of DataCite's services gave valuable input in all areas. Some like Pangaea also set Best Practices for data citation, that are still a standard today.

The Policy and Best Practices Working Group

This working group started as „Business Practices WG” with the goal to develop best business practices and articulate DataCite’s policy. The WG published a “Business Models Principles” document in 2012 with requirements and expectations both of DataCite members and their clients, the data centers.

The scope of the WG changed afterwards to only relations within DataCite’s organisation. The newly named „Policy and Best Practices Working Group“ investigated and documented best practices related to the business operations of DataCite‘s members. The WG developed and implemented policies and best practices, monitored new developments, initiatives and norms, supported evaluation and implementation of new strategies, and proposed new initiatives for further development by DataCite.

The Metadata Working Group

The Metadata Working Group is still active to this day. The Metadata Schema is the backbone of most of DataCite's services and has become a well and widely known standard. We started the group in 2010 with the objective to create a metadata schema that was as tight as possible, could be used by all kinds of scientific disciplines and still covered the most important elements to describe data. We based the schema on Dublin Core but expanded it to be a better fit specific for research data. The group held monthly virtual meetings discussing what elements should be included in the schema and how to define them. In between meetings specific questions were researched by sub-groups or individuals, until the first version of the DataCite Metadata Schema was released in January 2011. It consisted of 17 elements, of which only 5 were mandatory. We reached our goal to keep it lean and inter-disciplinary, and we were praised by the metadata community for it. The schema was adopted by the data centers who registered DOIs with DataCite, and we got a lot of feedback from them - a valuable source of input to this day. So far there are five minor and two major new versions of the Metadata Schema, each incorporating the feedback from our community.

The TechTeam

The Tech Team consisted mostly of two developers, Sebastian Peters at the TIB and Ed Zukowsky at the British Library. They developed the first version of the Metadata Store (MDS) which was in use until last year. They added a lot of basic and useful services built upon the MDS and the metadata associated with DOIs, like the search portal, the OAI-PMH metadata harvesting, statistics or link redirection to allow computers to directly access the data behind the DOIs instead of the metadata. They also started the cooperation with CrossRef. One of the first services out of this cooperation was the DOI Citation Formatter, which allowes to extract metadata automatically from a DOI and build a full citation. Many of their services are still in use today or have become the foundation of modernized versions.



Over time, DataCite has become more professional and employed its own staff, which helped it grow and incorporate new services like re3data.org or Make Data Count. It has been a great time to help build this amazing organization and I wish DataCite and it's staff a lot of success for the future!
