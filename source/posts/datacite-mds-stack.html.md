In May we [announced](https://makedatacount.org/2020/05/05/igniting-change-our-next-steps/) that we have received additional funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for work on the Make Data Count (MDC) initiative. This will enable DataCite to do work in two important areas:

\* Increase adoption of standardized data usage across repositories by developing a log processing service that offloads much of the hard work from repositories

\* Implement a bibliometrics dashboard that enables bibliometricians – funded by a separate Sloan grant – to do quantitative studies around data usage and citation behaviors.
