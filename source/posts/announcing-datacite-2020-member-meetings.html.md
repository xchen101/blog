As a community organization, it is important that we have the opportunity to meet regularly to engage in open dialog about DataCite related matters.  I have really enjoyed meeting with many of you over the past month and gaining a better understanding of what DataCite can do for you. The staff and I are always available for calls or meetings whenever you have questions or suggestions. As the end of 2019 approaches, we also wanted to communicate planned in-person and virtual meeting for 2020 as soon as possible.  

Following the member meeting in Philadelphia where the DataCite 10 year celebration took place, we would like to continue this format and provide an opportunity for us as a community to come together, share best practices, discuss common themes and define DataCite priorities for the future. As such, in 2020 we have planned several meetings to ensure that we will have opportunities for us to meet and discuss important matters (both virtually and in-person):



* Annual Member Meeting: October 23
* Business Meeting and Board Elections: April 30
* Additional Community Meetings: February 5 & TBD
* Open Hours: Monthly
