Earlier this year, we [announced the retirement](https://doi.org/10.5438/4j6f-0r45) of our Executive Director, Trisha Cruse.  After an extensive search, led by DataCite’s Executive Board, we are proud to announce that Matt Buys will join DataCite as Executive Director beginning October 14, 2019.  

Matt comes to us from [ORCID](orcid.org) and brings experience in leading global teams and scaling persistent identifier infrastructure to share information on a global scale. The Board and staff are extremely pleased that Matt will be joining DataCite and believe that Matt’s extensive experience building communities and growing membership will help DataCite continue its upward trajectory.

Matt told us: “I am honored to be joining DataCite at such an exciting time. DataCite plays an integral role in  the open research information infrastructure, providing the means to create, find, cite, connect, and use research data. I am especially looking forward to meeting DataCite’s members, learning more about their needs, and discussing our shared goals. Trisha’s leadership of DataCite has made a significant impact and she will be missed by us all. She is leaving DataCite a much stronger organization, and I am very grateful for her support and guidance during the transition period. Together with the DataCite team, I look forward to continuing to build our community, delivering high-quality services, and ensuring our organization’s future sustainability.”

On a more personal note, Matt grew up in South Africa and is now based in Amsterdam. He enjoys being outdoors and, in his spare time, loves completing challenges that test his mind and body. Recently, Matt completed an extreme ultra trail run in the Dolomites!
