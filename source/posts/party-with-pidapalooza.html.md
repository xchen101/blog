PIDapalooza is going online in 2021! We wish we could all be together in person for the fifth (!) festival of persistent identifiers, but we’re excited to bring **the world’s largest—and longest—virtual PID party** directly to your desk, your couch, your balcony—really, anywhere there’s a strong WiFi signal.

PIDapalooza 2021 will be a **24-hour nonstop PID party happening around the world**. PIDapalooza has never been a regular conference and this one will be no different!

The **party starts on January 27 at 14:30 UTC** ([see the time in your location here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=PIDapalooza+2021&iso=20210127T1430)). Sessions will take place over the course of the following 24 hours. That’s right: we’re partying all night long and no matter your time zone, you’ll be able to join in.



More details to come soon about the program, the structure, and how to participate.



In the meantime:



* Mark your calendars!
* Think about a session to propose, any keynotes or program topics to suggest, and any co-located meetings you might want to hold that week. We’ll send out a call for proposals toward the end of September
* Add your favorite jam to the [2021 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1qpTPRSq6fOf8W5lDOxXl4?si=763YuTtcRVS7_BHC-SWmeg)! 
* Keep on rockin’ the PIDs!

_PIDapalooza 2021 is brought to you by the following PID groupies:_

_California Digital Library, Crossref, DataCite, NISO (welcome to our newest groupie!), and ORCID_
