As a membership organization we take our community engagement activities very seriously. We jump at the chance to interact with our members, whether it be at conferences, steering group meetings, our general assembly, or during DataCite Open Hours. DataCite Open Hours is a one-hour monthly call for discussion and information sharing (we like to think of them as a DataCite meet-up) where we invite DataCite members and community to join us as we share the latest product developments and releases We also like to take the opportunity to gather feedback to help us make sure we are steering things in the right direction. The format is always informal and interactive.

The year is flying by. And there’s already been loads of new updates and developments at DataCite, and from the community and the PID world at large. So here, I would like to take a moment to reflect back on the last 8 months of DataCite Open Hours, since I took of as the host. Those who have joined us for Open Hours will know we like to ask questions, and we have lots of fun using polling tools. So here is a rundown of some of the key information that we have gathered during our Open Hours meet-ups so far. Keep in mind that the number of participants varies each month, and we don’t claim the views expressed necessarily represent the whole community. 

Who’s out there?

We wanted to know who was attending our Open Hours sessions and what kinds of institutions they were from. The results of the polls didn’t leave us too perplexed, since, as expected, the majority of the attendees described themselves as librarians or developers coming from universities and libraries. However, now we know we have mixed expertise in the audience we can try to balance the sessions, and we launched Dev Chat, similar to Open Hours, but with developer focused themes and content.

Which of the following best describes you?

DOI registration - DOI Fabrica

At the end of last year, we were working on the development of the new form for creating DOIs in Fabrica. Open Hours was an opportunity to find out what really mattered to users. From the results, we saw that related identifiers and author information like ORCIDs and affiliations were considered most important as additional fields in the form. We took this on-board and already implemented a name identifier field in Fabrica. 

Which types of information do you most want to be able to add via Fabrica form fields?
