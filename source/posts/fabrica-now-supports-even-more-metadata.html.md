Today, DataCite is very pleased to announce a major update to the DOI Fabrica form. With this update, you can now add metadata for every possible field in the entire [DataCite Metadata Schema](https://schema.datacite.org). This includes related identifiers, subjects, funding, geolocation, and more. Now the DOIs you create and update via the form will be just like the DOIs you create and update via the APIs. This update has been a long time coming, and we hope you're as excited as we are.

We're also trying something a little different with this release. The new form will be available to everyone in an open beta. We recognize that our member community has diverse needs, and we thought the best way to uncover additional edge cases would be to have all of you put the form through its paces "in the wild" in your normal workflows. So please give the new form a spin and send us your feedback and comments. Together we'll refine the form to be the best it can be. 

If you need help getting started with the new form, please consult our [updated support pages](https://support.datacite.org/docs/field-descriptions-for-form). For any other questions or comments, you can reach us at [mailto:support@datacite.org](support@datacite.org).
