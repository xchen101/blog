We are pleased to announce the publication of version 3.0 of the “Metadata Schema for the Description of Research Data Repositories” [@https://doi.org/10.2312/RE3.008].

This updated version of the re3data.org schema incorporates feedback from users as well as changes in registry policies and structural adjustments to the schema designed to better reflect changes in the landscape of research data repositories. New faceted and filtered search capabilities have also been added to improve searching of re3data.org.READMORE

re3data.org is a service of [DataCite](http://datacite.org), listing over 1.400 research data repositories. Since 2012, re3data.org has provided researchers, funding bodies, publishers and other research organizations with detailed information about research data repositories. After the merger of DataBib and re3data.org in 2014, the joint registry started collaborating with DataCite. In 2015, the DataCite General Assembly officially approved the inclusion of re3data.org into its service portfolio.
