[PIDapalooza 2020](https://www.pidapalooza.org/upcoming-festival) is just around the corner (January 29-30, Lisbon, Portugal) — and it’s going to be fun! We have a great venue, the fabulous [Belem Cultural Center](https://www.ccb.pt/Default/en/Homepage), and a great lineup:



* On the main stage — three amazing keynotes: Maria Fernanda Rollo ([NOVA FSCH](https://www.fcsh.unl.pt/)), Beth Plale ([NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/)), and Kathryn Kaiser ([University of Alabama, Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/home/)). Plus a surprise local guest to help celebrate the start of the event!
* Throughout the event — more than 35 fast-paced sessions on a wide range of PID themes, from Achieving Persistence through Sustainability to PID Success Stories, and beyond
* Five PID party sessions — 30-60 minutes of PID fun and games galore, led by the likes of [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), [NISO](https://www.niso.org/), and [TIB Hanover](https://www.tib.eu/en/)
* Our first-ever lightning talks — make sure you sign up on day 1 for your slot in this new one-hour session of rapid-fire, five-minute talks on the PID topic of your choice
* Not one, but two unmissable social events — a pay-your-own-way pre-meeting get-together at the TimeOut Market Lisbon on January 28, and the official PIDapalooza reception at 5:30pm on January 29 (venue to be announced soon).
* Plus all the usual fun you’ve come to expect from your favorite PID festival — the lighting of the eternal flame, your very own PIDapalooza T-shirt, the pub quiz, the wrap-up session, and more!



You can see the full lineup [here](https://www.pidapalooza.org/schedule), and tickets are now on sale (a bargain at just US$150!). Half of the available places are already filled (as of early December) —[ so get yours now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pidapalooza-2020-registration-60971406117?ref=ecount)! 



Whether you’ll be attending PIDapalooza for the first or the fourth time — or if you’ve never attended — we’d also love to hear your thoughts about the event, so please take a few minutes to complete this [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs4FklBqeRCd6krWwLwFaLaZIAHdKFonbLUs_o3PUCPDEybg/viewform?usp=sf_link). We’ll share the results at PIDapalooza 2020, and on our blogs.



Thanks — and see you in January!
