DataCite DOIs describe resources such as datasets, samples, software and publications with rich metadata. An important part of this metadata is the description of connections between resources that use persistent identifiers (PIDs) provided by DataCite and others (Crossref, ORCID, ROR, ISNI, IGSN, etc.). Together these resources and their connections form a graph, the PID Graph [@https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66].
