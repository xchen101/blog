We are very pleased to announce the launch of our new website: [www.datacite.org](https://www.datacite.org)! Our website is the central place for information about DataCite and we love the new look! It has become the hub for all our services and now it delivers our latest news and supports the community with a responsive easy-to-use interface.READMORE

DataCite’s [mission](http://datacite.org/mission.html) is to help the research community locate, identify, and cite research data with confidence. Our new website contains a lot of new information including resources for the community and tools for our researchers. Now it is easier than ever to find new services, integrate them and get the best out of DataCite.

On the technical side, we have migrated the old Drupal backend to a new static site generator ([Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)), reshaped the content and added a bunch of new stuff, including an integration to this blog.
